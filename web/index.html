    <h2>dnsomatic</h2>
    <p>dnsomatic is a tool that can be used to keep your IP in sync with
    multiple dynamic dns services by making a single update request.</p>

    <p>You are free to use or modify dnsomatic under the terms of the
    GPLv3.</p>

    <h2>Use and Configuration</h2>
    <p>To use it, you must have a valid account at <a
    href="http://dnsomatic.com">DNS-o-Matic</a>.  This account should be
    associated with one or more dynamic dns services (zoneedit, dyndns, etc).
    The author uses both of those listed.</p>

    <p>Before your first use, you must create at least a basic configuration
    file.  For most people, this will consist of nothing more than the
    following:</p>

    <pre>
      defaults:
	username: &lt;YOUR_DNSOMATIC_USERNAME&gt;
	password: &lt;YOUR_DNSOMATIC_PASSWORD&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>On *nix hosts, the default configuration file is $HOME/.dnsomatic.cf.
    On Windows, the file should be %APPDATA%/.dnsomatic.cf.</p>

    <p>With that configuration in place, you can run $PATH_TO_GEM_BIN/dnsomatic
    -a, which will run an update an emit a message if successful.  By default
    (eg: without -a) no output is made unless there is an error condition.</p>

    <p>To see all program options, run dnsomatic with -h or --help.</p>

    <p>More thorough information is currently available by running ri
    DNSOMatic.</p>

    <h2>Downloads</h2>

    <p>You may download the gem for dnsomatic at the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/dnsomatic">Rubyforge Project Page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Todo</h2>
    <p>There is still much to be done with this project, mostly in terms of
    code cleanup, unit testing and error handling.  For a list of outstanding
    items, see the <a
